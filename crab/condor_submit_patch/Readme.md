Usually I would work with crab

For cluster submission I am running only with local T2 files

the submitter is 'postprocessor_task_severalsamples.py'

it needs and exacutable and a tarbell of the release where the postprocessing modules are defined
currently defined as:
exec_path = "exec_postproc.sh"
tar_path = "../rel2.tar.gz"
